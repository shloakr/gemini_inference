The main reason is the market is so large. To give an example, there are 80 million single family homes. They change their heating system every ~20 years if not more often. That means 4M heating systems changed per year. At say $5k per upgrade that is a $20B annual market - in just heating systems. Lets say its $10k per upgrade, thats $40B. HUGE markets. The best ideas are software only ideas that accelerate green transitions on this market. Something like Aurora Solar for example. But also things like <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35138319>. Sometimes you have to do the hardware but often you don\u2019t have to touch hardware. Given how extremely basic many of the functions of just local installers/contractors are - from price transparency, to payment to scheduling etc - there is huge amount of opportunity in just that area. but this applies to everything in homes, stoves, ev chargers, water heaters etc",
